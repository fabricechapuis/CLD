### Deploy the elastic load balancer

In this task you will create a load balancer in AWS that will receive
the HTTP requests from clients and forward them to the Drupal
instances.

## Task 01 Prerequisites for the ELB

* Create a dedicated security group

|Key|Value|
|:--|:--|
|Name|SG-DEVOPSTEAM[XX]-LB|
|Inbound Rules|Application Load Balancer|
|Outbound Rules|Refer to the infra schema|

```bash
[INPUT]


[OUTPUT]

```

* Create the Target Group

|Key|Value|
|:--|:--|
|Target type|Instances|
|Name|TG-DEVOPSTEAM[XX]|
|Protocol and port|Refer to the infra schema|
|Ip Address type|IPv4|
|VPC|Refer to the infra schema|
|Protocol version|HTTP1|
|Health check protocol|HTTP|
|Health check path|/|
|Port|Traffic port|
|Healthy threshold|2 consecutive health check successes|
|Unhealthy threshold|2 consecutive health check failures|
|Timeout|5 seconds|
|Interval|10 seconds|
|Success codes|200|

```PowerShell
[INPUT]
aws elbv2 create-target-group --name "TG-DEVOPSTEAM04" --protocol "HTTP" --port 8080 --vpc-id "vpc-03d46c285a2af77ba" --health-check-protocol "HTTP" --protocol-version "HTTP1" --ip-address-type "ipv4" --target-type "instance" --health-check-path "/" --health-check-port "traffic-port" --healthy-threshold-count 2 --unhealthy-threshold-count 2 --health-check-timeout-seconds 5 --health-check-interval-seconds 10 --matcher "HttpCode=200"

[OUTPUT]
{
    "TargetGroups": [
        {
            "TargetGroupArn": "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:eu-west-3:709024702237:targetgroup/TG-DEVOPSTEAM04/a5118a499ec2b2d2",
            "TargetGroupName": "TG-DEVOPSTEAM04",
            "Protocol": "HTTP",
            "Port": 8080,
            "VpcId": "vpc-03d46c285a2af77ba",
            "HealthCheckProtocol": "HTTP",
            "HealthCheckPort": "traffic-port",
            "HealthCheckEnabled": true,
            "HealthCheckIntervalSeconds": 10,
            "HealthCheckTimeoutSeconds": 5,
            "HealthyThresholdCount": 2,
            "UnhealthyThresholdCount": 2,
            "HealthCheckPath": "/",
            "Matcher": {
                "HttpCode": "200"
            },
            "TargetType": "instance",
            "ProtocolVersion": "HTTP1",
            "IpAddressType": "ipv4"
        }
    ]
}
```


## Task 02 Deploy the Load Balancer

[Source](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/)

* Create the Load Balancer

|Key|Value|
|:--|:--|
|Type|Application Load Balancer|
|Name|ELB-DEVOPSTEAM99|
|Scheme|Internal|
|Ip Address type|IPv4|
|VPC|Refer to the infra schema|
|Security group|Refer to the infra schema|
|Listeners Protocol and port|Refer to the infra schema|
|Target group|Your own target group created in task 01|

Provide the following answers (leave any
field not mentioned at its default value):

```bash
[INPUT]


[OUTPUT]

```

* Get the ELB FQDN (DNS NAME - A Record)

```bash
[INPUT]


[OUTPUT]

```

* Get the ELB deployment status

Note : In the EC2 console select the Target Group. In the
       lower half of the panel, click on the **Targets** tab. Watch the
       status of the instance go from **unused** to **initial**.

* Ask the DMZ administrator to register your ELB with the reverse proxy via the private teams channel

* Update your string connection to test your ELB and test it

```bash
//connection string updated
```

* Test your application through your ssh tunneling

```bash
[INPUT]
curl localhost:[local port forwarded]

[OUTPUT]

```

#### Questions - Analysis

* On your local machine resolve the DNS name of the load balancer into
  an IP address using the `nslookup` command (works on Linux, macOS and Windows). Write
  the DNS name and the resolved IP Address(es) into the report.

```
//TODO
```

* From your Drupal instance, identify the ip from which requests are sent by the Load Balancer.

Help : execute `tcpdump port 8080`

```
//TODO
```

* In the Apache access log identify the health check accesses from the
  load balancer and copy some samples into the report.

```
//TODO
```

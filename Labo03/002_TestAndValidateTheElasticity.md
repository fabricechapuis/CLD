## Simulate heavy load to trigger a scaling action

* [Install the package "stress" on your Drupal instance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-stress-command-with-examples/)

* [Install the package htop on your Drupal instance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/htop-command-in-linux-with-examples/)

* Check how many vCPU are available (with htop command)

```
[INPUT]
htop

[OUTPUT]
//copy the part representing vCPus, RAM and swap usage
```

![htop](./img/htop.png)

### Stress your instance

```
[INPUT]
//stress command

[OUTPUT]
//copy the part representing vCPus, RAM and swap usage
//tip : use two ssh sessions....
```

* (Scale-IN) Observe the autoscaling effect on your infa

//Validate that the various instances have been distributed between the two available az.
[INPUT]
//aws cli command

[OUTPUT]

* (Scale-OUT) As soon as all 4 instances have started, end stress on the main machine.

## Release Cloud resources

Once you have completed this lab release the cloud resources to avoid
unnecessary charges:

* Terminate the EC2 instances.
    * Make sure the attached EBS volumes are deleted as well.
* Delete the Auto Scaling group.
* Delete the Elastic Load Balancer.
* Delete the RDS instance.

(this last part does not need to be documented in your report.)
